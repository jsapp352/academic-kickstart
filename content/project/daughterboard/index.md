- Each daughterboard implements the 100 hardware synapses that are required for each hidden-layer neuron.
- The daughterboard performs 100 multiplication operations simultaneuosly, and the sum of the products is calculated in logarithmic time complexity using an analog adder tree.
- TACOCAT uses three daughterboard PCBs.
