- The TACOCAT motherboard design includes all of the network's hardware-based artificial neurons along with the synapses connecting the hidden-layer neurons to the output-layer neurons.
- The motherboard also includes a 32-bit ARM microcontroller that measures neuron voltages and drives the 100 pixel input lines that connect to each daughterboard.
- The motherboard is connected to a host PC via I2C datalink.
